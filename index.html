	<h2>About Me</h2>
	<p>I am a Texas A&M graduate, of the <span id="aggie" strong>Fightin' Texas Aggie Class of 2014</span>. Since graduation, I have been working as a Plant Operator on a natural gas plant, learning both the fundamentals of the energy sector, as well as live data analysis.
		A large portion of my time has been focused on my company's Net Zero Carbon initiative, and have taken to participating in an emmissions reduction group that focuses on minimizing the carbon output of other plants around West Texas.
		The vast majority of this initiative has been aimed directly at the control systems that run the plants and maintain operations. Specifically, I have performed optimization procedures on existing processes and control loops.
		The deeper I dove into these systems, the more I came face to face with programming. I couldn't help but find the concepts fascinating and felt compelled to learn more about the multitude of languages used in all aspects of running controlling programs in the plant.
		And that's really all it took. The first language I looked into was Python, and have been hooked on learning coding languages and concepts since.
		So far I've been learning about Python, Java, SQL, HTML, CSS, Git and Bash. I have enjoyed learning all this immensely, and I aim to continue learning as much as I can.
		With any luck, I'll even be able to make a career out of it.
